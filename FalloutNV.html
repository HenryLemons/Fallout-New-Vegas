    <h1>Brief Starting knowledge for Fallout New Vegas.</h1>
    <p>Fallout New Vegas is a survival post-apocalyptic rpg with multiple endings. It was made Obsidian Studios, and was inspired by the original topdown turn-based rpg's fallout 1 and fallout 2. With those games as an 
    insparation and Fallout 3 being out, Obsidian studio took both the Fallout 3 base gameplay and the randomness of the original games. This website will talk about the history of obsidian, what Fallout New Vegas is about 
    with a skill calculator, the story when you reach the tops, factions, ranking the dlcs, and the stores to buy the game online.</p>

  <div id="history">
    <h1>What is the history of the Studio behind Fallout New Vegas?</h1>
    <p>this would talk about the history of Obsidian Entertainment and their involvment with the fallout series.</p>
    <p>The studio that made Fallout New Vegas is Obsidian Entertainment. They didn't make the first two fallout games because those games were made by Interplay but Obsidian saw those games and took a lot of insperation
      from them to make New Vegas stick out from fallout 3. Most of the diffrences is how there are multiple ways to get an ending in New Vegas with multiple routes you can take with factions, choices, and options. 
      Unlike fallout 3, everyone can die meaning there has to be a way for the player to get to the end game with everyone else dead, and obsidian did account for this possiblity. There are little details in new vegas 
      where you finish a quest and it gets mentioned by someone, making the game feel more interactive than it is. Those details make the game feel more alive and makes the player feel like they are making changes in the
      game. Obsidian took that insperation from the original fallout games.</p>

  <div id="about"> 
    <h1>What is Fallout New Vegas about?</h1>
    <p>Fallout New Vegas is a apocalyptic survival rpg. It has stats from that help make diffrent builds for the game, and that makes each playthrough unique.</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Fallout New Vegas has skills that will make you better and worse at things. The skills are Barter, Energy weapons, Explosives, Guns, Lockpick, 
      Medicine, Melee Weapons, Repair, Science, Sneak, Speech, Survival, Unarmed. In this game skill checks are common for dialog and quests that use skills and SPECIAL. The player
      also tag 3 diffrent skills to add 15 more skill points in that skill. The stats in the begining is dependent on your SPECIAL.
    </p>
    <h2>SPECIAL</h2>
    <p> SPECIAL stands for strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intellegence, agility, and luck. Strength allows the coureir to carry more items and melee.
      Perception increases the chance you will hit your target in vats and modifies Explosives, Lockpick and Energy Weapons skills. Endurance determains how much hp you will have, how
       much poisen and radiation resistance, and it effects Unarmed and Survival. Charisma boosts Barter, Speech and Companion Nerve. Intellegence affects Skill Points you'll be able to distribute
        when you level up. Agility affects your Guns and Sneak skills, and the number of Action Points available for V.A.T.S. Luck increases critical strike chance and your odds of winning in a 
      casino. SPECIAL gives 2 points or in its respective skills.
    </p>
    <h2>Weapons</h2>      <img src="https://i.redd.it/iv57c7x4mlm71.jpg" alt="Guass rifle with energy requirment of 75 and strength of 5" width="500" >
    <p>
      Weapons in Fallout New Vegas have requirments to use them effectivly. it will have a strength requirment and the weapons respective skill to use. The image above shows the 
      requirments. On the left it has a box with an energy sign with a 75 on it which means you need 75 in energy weapons to use it effectivly. On the right it shows STR 5 meaning you 
      5 strength to use the weapon effectivly. Below the energy requirment is the damage and dps, and it shows how much damage you do in one shot and one second. Below the dps is the condition
      of the weapon, and if the condition of the weapon is less than the pinched section it will do less damage and jam more often. On the right of the condition will show what amunition
      it will take. With amunition there are many types of amunition that you can use and make. The amunition will have diffrent effects like working better with light armor enemies but worse on 
      heavy armor enemies. And when you fire the weapon and it takes amunition you have a chance to get either a shell casing or empty cell depending if its a gun or energy weapon.
    </p>
    <h2>Skill Calculator.</h2>        <p>This calculator only helps with the begining of the game so you should only add them up to 40 for it to be accurate for the begining.</p>

      <h2>Armor</h2>
        <p>There are diffrent types of armor in Fallout New Vegas and each armor type has its perks and detrements. There is Light, Medium, Heavy, Power Armor, and clothing.</p>
      <h2>Light Armor</h2>
        <p>This armor has low weight and low dt.Wearing any light armor (including clothing) incurs no additional penalties.</p>
      <h2>Medium Armor</h2>
        <p>This armor has medium weight with medium dt. Wearing medium armor causes the wearer to move 7.5% slower and have their effective sneak reduced by 10.</p>
      <h2>Heavy Armor</h2>
        <p>This armor has high weight but great dt. Wearing heavy armor causes the wearer to move 15% slower and have their effective sneak reduced by 20.</p>
      <h2>Power Armor</h2>
        <p>Power armor is a heavy armor that needs training to use and there are two ways to getting it is through the brotherhood of steel, and a companion quest. The only power 
          armor that doesn't need training is the NCR salvaged power armor.
        </p>
      <h2>Clothing</h2>
      <p>Most wearable items that are classed as clothing (such as hats and eyewear) cannot be repaired by merchants that offer repair services. This requires you to either use 
        compatible clothing in the item's class or select the Jury Rigging perk to repair clothing items.</p>
      <h2>Damage resistance</h2>
        <p>Damage resistance is calculated before DT. Things that give you Damage Resistance is Med-X, Battle Brew, and Slasher. There are only 3 armors that give Damage resistance and its the 
          Vault 11 jumpsuit that gives 1, the rebreather that gives 3, and Scientist outfit that gives 3.
        </p>
      <h2>Damage Threshold</h2>
        <p> DT can function as an outright subtraction: if a shot is fired with a damage value of 40 against a DT of 10, then 10 damage will be ignored. However, the sequence of
           calculations differs compared to previous games. DR is applied first. The value after this adjustment depends on any DR a player character has, which is capped to a DR 
           of 85 (85%); however, DR above 80 does nothing, so the theoretical cap is 80.
          </p>
      <h2>Ammo types</h2>
        <p>In Fallout New Vegas has diffrent types of ammo for diffrent types of situations. The diffrent types of guns also have options for ammo. For coventinal guns was the 
          regular ammo you get off of enemys while surplus can only be bought and decreases the guns condition a lot faster. There are also hollow point for enemys that have low 
          dt and does more damage but for more armored enemies it does little, but armor piercing is used for those enemies. For explosive guns there are a multitude of explosives 
          you can choose from that are grenade types. For energy weapons you have increased charges and damage for each shot, but it takes more weapon condition away. With 
          this many options for guns and more options with ammo, you have a lot of choices you can make each playthrough.
        </p>
      <h2>Types of damage</h2>
       <p>There are many types of damage in fallout new vegas. There is regular damage from bullets and melee attacks, fire damage from flamers that deal damage over time, fall damage
         is from falling long distances, and effect damage that takes an interger amount of health over time and sometimes can be cured. Radiation is another form of damage 
         of its own with its own health bar of 1,000. Every 200 rads will cause ill effects that reduce your special stats, and at 200 rads it takes 1 END away. At 400 
         -2 END, -1 AGL. At 600 rads -3 END, -2 AGL, -1 STR. At 800 rads -3 END, -2 AGL, -2 STR. And at 1000 rads you will die. Pulse is used for robots and does more damage to 
         them and their limbs.

  <div id="story">
    <h1>What is the story of Fallout New Vegas?</h1>
    <p>The story of Fallout New Vegas starts as the courier (the player) gets captured by a man in a checkered suit and two great khans. The checkered man shoots the courier in the head and leaves them in a shallow grave when a securitron sees that the courier is still alive and takes them to the local doctor in town Doc Mitchell. 
This is where you first make decisions of the game, you get to decide your special stats skills and character looks and gender. As the decisions influence what you are good and bad at at the game you should think about them and not just be random. When that is all said and done  and you leave Doc Mitchell house, you see Goodsprings. Goodsprings is a little town in the mojave that is self-sufficient, and is the location of the tutorial of Fallout New Vegas, that will help anyone in need. But with that attitude they do get into some trouble every now and then.
The trouble is that they are housing a person named Ringo that a recent gang of convicts, that are called powder gangers, want to kill because he was a part of a caravan that they attacked. With the Powder gangers intimidating the people of goodsprings into giving away Ringo and them not budging it’s up to you to tip the scale in someone's favor. This is the first BIG moral decision in the game where you can be good or evil. It takes the same effort for either option of helping the town or the convicts but one is a good deed and the other is a bad deed.
No matter what choice you chose you will still need to head to primm to see that it's been overrun with convicts with no gang relations making the decision for powder gangers not help at all. Once inside the casino and begin talking to Johnson Nash who reveals more details about the courier job, he doesn’t know but thinks Beagle who was captured by the convicts does know. Once all is said and done, you find another lead at novac but have to go through nipton, but before you go the town needs a sheriff and you can pick who becomes the sheriff. You don't have to but you can.
Once you reach nipton, you stumble across a terrible sight. The town was attacked and some people are either burning corpses or crucified on crosses. You soon learn who caused such atrocities, and the group that they belong to. The legion has done a lottery to find out who lives and dies in this town, leaving only two survivors. Their names are  Oliver Swanick and boxcar. Oliver was the first place winner so got to go scot free and boxcar was second place so got his legs broken. There is no way to stop this and no decisions to be made. 
When you get to novac and ask around and get to the sniper in the t rex statue, you find out that the sniper, Manny Vargas, knows about him and you find out that the checkered man's name is benny. But that information is only told after doing a side quest or by other means. You can Pickpocket or kill Manny and take the holotape from his inventory, Enter Manny's motel room and access the terminal in the back, which has a single entry that also offers the holotape, or If one has the Confirmed Bachelor perk, completing the side quest can be bypassed, though Manny will still offer it to be done if desired. No matter what you choose, you are heading to Boulder city now.
When arriving at Boulder city, it has an ongoing hostage negotiation. The negotiation is between the ncr and the great khans, and you can tip the scales. There are many ways you can do this but in the end it turns out the same again where you learn where benny went. You will now be heading to the new vegas strip and head to the tops.

When heading to the strip you will have to enter freeside. Freeside is the slums of the strip where the ruling laws are the kings, ncr, and the The Followers of the Apocalypse. You can do stuff for the kings, ncr, and the followers in freeside but you need to get into the strip. When you try to get into the strip you learn you need 2,000 caps to get in. There are ways around it like a science check and a fake pass but caps aren't hard to get in vegas.
Now that you are in the strip and head to the tops, you get told you can't have your weapons in the tops to stop people from fighting. If you gathered evidence about your near death experience from Benny you can get your weapons and Benny alone. But other things can happen and when you do your stuff at the tops and leave you get confronted by a legion messenger and a ncr messenger. Now you have another big choice to choose, but you now have to figure it out by yourself because this part of the game is where the training wheels come off.
</p>
    <h2>Big Factions</h2>
      <p>There are two big factions in Fallout New Vegas. The NCR and the Caesar's Legion. Warning: I am biased so take this with a grain of salt from the white legs home.</p>
    <h3>The NCR</h3>
      <p>The NCR is a republic and is an abbreviation of New California Republic. The NCR stands for pre-war morals and government, so taxes, laws, and corruption is a part of life in the NCR regions. The NCR is fighting for hover damn so they can send power to the east coast of the US.
    And when the game takes place the NCR has control of hover damn but the legion is preparing an attack to take the damn. As a republic they have a president named Aaron Kimball.</p>
    <h3>Caesar's Legion</h3>
      <p>The legion stands for the even older values of rome with some twists. They are slavers, raiders, but they don't allow chems like buffout and pshyco. They asimilate tribes and make them think that they were barbarians and the legion civilised them. They are ruled by Caeser, a man with a brain tumor and many npc's say that the legion will fall 
      when Caesar dies. </p>
    <h2>Small Factions mentioned</h2>
      <h3>Powder Gangers</h3>
        <p>Conficts that escaped the NCR's rehabilitation camp. They are violent with dynamite.</p>
      <h3>GoodSprings</h3>
        <p>Towns folk of GoodSprings that are willing to help anyone. They are the tutorial town of this game.</p>
      <h3>Great Khans</h3>
        <p>A tribe of drug makers and raiders. They want to seek their previous glory and get revenge on the NCR for their wrongful genocide agaist their people.</p>
      <h3>The Kings</h3>
        <p>A group of elvis impersonators that act like the law enforcement of freeside. They are ruled by The King who is resonable and you can get a favor from.</p>
      <h3>The Followers of the Apocalypse</h3>
        <p>A group of educated people who want nothing else but to help others rebuild societys good parts and offer help with little to no cost to others. They are true and just people.</p>
    <h2>Why are there factions to begin with.</h2>
      <p>Unlike in fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas has multiple endings you can get with each decision you make impacting the world you inhabit. Having factions, big and small, makes even killing people affect the game by gaining faction approval or disapproval.
      Thus by adding factions and making each faction either like you or hate you makes the game more imersive and the story more interactable than fallout 3. There are more faction than the ones i've listed but you can find them when you are playing the game.</p>

  <div id="dlc">
    <h1>How are the DLC's?</h1>
    <p>this will talk about the dlc's and rank them at the end.</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Dlc 1 : Courier's Stash</h3>
        <p>This dlc is a 9/10 dlc. It just gives you some extra items in the beginning of the game you can keep or sell for caps so you can customize your build to your liking.
           Im taking away 1 star due to it feeling like a pay to win dlc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dlc 2 :Gun Runners' Arsenal</h3>
        <p>This dlc is a 10/10 because it adds a lot of customizations and unique weapons to the game for a decent price so it doesn't feel broken and the mods you can get for 
          your weapons are great as well. The developers also did a nod at a fan series called fallout: nuka break with a weapon called the nuka breaker.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dlc 3: Dead Money</h3>
        <p>The dlc takes place in the Sierra Madre Casino where you have to do a heist with 3 other companions while trying not to die to the cloud or the ghosts of the casino. 
          When you get into the casino you have to meet your companions again and depending on what you did in the start of the dlc you either have to kill them or not have to 
          kill them. At the end you break into the vault and have to get out without dying.
        </p><br>
        <p>This dlc is a 3/10. It's a low score due to it being a stealth, horror dlc that takes away all of your items but it does give them back at the end though. It has a 
          lot of endings you can get but the best ending is hard to get unless you know what you are doing. It's low because I don't like stealth missions. The only redeeming 
          quality is the weapons and caps you can get from this dlc. It also took 5 hours and you can't return.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dlc 4: Honests Hearts</h3>
      <p>	The dlc starts as you hear an ad on the radio by the Happy Trails Caravan Company for a caravan to travel to the untouched by nuclear fallout Zion national park to
         reconnect with town and they need your help to stop raiders and aggressive tribals in that area. When you get to Zion the caravan you are with dies to the white legs 
         that have been trying to take over that region in the name of the legion. You meet a friendly tribal of the dead horse tribe that instructs you to see the burned man 
         named Joshua Graham. When you do meet him he tells you that the sorrows and dead horses are peaceful natives of the area and the white legs have been trying to get 
         Joshua Graham to kill him and join the legion. And instructs you to do some fetch quests. When the fetch quests are done you have two options, to fight or run away. 
         The endings change a lot depending on that decision but the best is to fight because it stops the white legs from attacking and the sorrows get hardened but depending 
         what you do they will be kind and strong enough to protect themselves or violent people.</p><br>
      <p>This dlc is a 7/10. There are a lot of things you can do that affect the ending you get but it doesn't take a long time, just 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how you 
        approach it. You can return to zion how many times you want to as well so it's great if you missed something so you can return to get it. In the end you get a lot of 
        unique weapons and armor when you leave zion so that's nice.</p>

      <h3>Dlc 5: Old world blues</h3>
      <p>	The dlc starts as you see a fallen satellite that when you get close at midnight you start the dlc. When you wake back up, you’re at the big empty with your brain 
        removed with your heart and spine. You meet 5 pre-war scientists that are being thwarted by the mean doctor mobius. Turns out he has your brian and that is keeping you
         and the other think tank trapped at the big mt. So you have to retrieve some parts to get into the Forbidden zone and get some audio logs to break the force fields to
          enter the forbidden zone. When you get in the forbidden zone you have to fight a giant robo-scorpion and when you beat it you get to know the truth about mobius. It 
          turns out that he wasn’t the bad guy but the good guy keeping the think tank trapped to save the world from their twisted experiments, and the items you collected and
           put your brain and their brains into new bodies or your own body. The ending of this dlc can be either good or bad depending on choices you have made where you can 
           keep all the think tank members alive or kill them. But no matter what you can always return to the big mt for a house that can do a lot of things for you.
      </p><br>
      <p>	This dlc is a 6/10. It's fun and each character has depth, the environmental storytelling is amazing but it has a lot of talking in the dlc. In total of 1 hour on 
        dialog. It has a lot of things you can get here that helps a lot. The house you get can do wonderful things for you if you put in the effort and get all the personality 
        chips for them and each of them have a slide for the ending if you get them. But in the end there are a lot of sex jokes in this dlc and it's hilarious. This dlc takes 
        about 3 hours to beat but it can take more or less time depending on how much you explore.

      <h3>Dlc 6: Lonesome road</h3>
      <p>	In this dlc the Courier's story comes full circle when you are contacted by the original Courier Six, a man by the name of Ulysses who refused to deliver the platinum
         chip at the start of New Vegas. In his transmission, Ulysses promises the answer as to why, but only if you take one last job—a job that leads you into the depths of 
         the hurricane-swept canyons of The Divide, a landscape torn apart by earthquakes and violent storms. The road to the Divide is a long and treacherous one, and of the 
         few to ever walk the road, none have ever returned.
      </p><br>
      <p>	This dlc is a 7/10 because of the difficulty spike in it and it's hard to rate it better since i haven't completed it yet. It's the final dlc the game received and
         it's a really good story. It's about 4 hours long but you can leave the divide whenever you want to so that it boasts the score by 2 points so you aren't constantly
          dying and can get repairs. 1 point is for how forgiving this dlc is to new players by saying you can leave at any time.
